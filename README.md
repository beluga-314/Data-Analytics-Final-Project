# Data-Analytics-Final-Project
Placement Prediction Portal


In this project, we built a portal which takes data related to their academics and skills from the student and predicts his placement details using Machine Learning models (Random Forest) and displays them
The data we have used is from the OCCAP team of IISc

Trained Models' checkpoints are given!
